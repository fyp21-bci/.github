# OpenBCI-Enabled Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Pediatric Neurorehabilitation 🧠💻

[cite_start]This project is a critical initiative by final-year engineering students at the **University of Moratuwa** to develop a life-changing **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** for children with severe motor impairments or a serious loss of muscle control and movement ability[cite: 5].

[cite_start]The BCI aims to restore **communication and access to digital environments** by translating the user's brain signals into digital commands[cite: 6, 41].

## 🎯 Project Objectives

[cite_start]Our mission is to create an impactful and game-changing system based on Electroencephalography (EEG)[cite: 91].

* [cite_start]**Develop an EEG-based BCI System:** Create a system to enable children with severe motor impairments to control an operating system interface using only their brain signals[cite: 91].
* [cite_start]**Demonstrate Proof-of-Concept:** Prove real-world usability through a practical case study that showcases the BCI's transformative power[cite: 92].
* [cite_start]**Build a Scalable Framework:** Develop a solution that can be extended to reach wider patient groups battling stroke, spinal cord injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases[cite: 93, 94].
* [cite_start]**Contribute to Academic Knowledge:** Drive innovation through research publications and elevate our department's capacity[cite: 95].

## 💡 Why Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) Matter

[cite_start]A BCI is a revolutionary technology that provides direct communication between the human brain and external devices[cite: 63]. [cite_start]It captures brain signals, typically through non-invasive **electroencephalography (EEG)** [cite: 64] [cite_start]and translates them into precise digital commands, allowing control of computers and applications without physical movement[cite: 64].

[cite_start]For children trapped by severe motor impairments, BCI is a **lifeline**, unlocking access to education, entertainment, and communication[cite: 66].

## 🔬 Technology: OpenBCI™ Hardware

[cite_start]We utilize the **OpenBCI™ platform**[cite: 7]. [cite_start]OpenBCI™ is an affordable, open-source platform that provides high-quality, precise biosensing instruments, like the **Cyton board**, that capture clear and detailed electrical signals from the brain with precision[cite: 7, 117, 118]. [cite_start]This is critical as **reliable data is the foundation** of any successful BCI project[cite: 119].

### Key Benefits of OpenBCI™

* [cite_start]**High-Quality Precision:** Cyton boards are engineered to capture multi-channel EEG signals accurately, ensuring the brain's commands are interpreted correctly[cite: 122, 123].
* [cite_start]**Pediatric Suitability:** The **Ultracortex headsets** are specifically designed to be adjustable, safe, and comfortable for children[cite: 124, 125].
* [cite_start]**Modularity for Research:** Flexible hardware allows for easy testing of various BCI approaches (e.g., SSVEP, P300, Motor Imagery), which is key to ongoing research and expanding system capabilities[cite: 126, 127].
* [cite_start]**Time & Cost Efficiency:** Allows the team to focus directly on signal processing and interface design rather than developing basic hardware from scratch[cite: 128, 129].
* [cite_start]**Long-Term Value:** The OpenBCI™ hardware will become a permanent, shared resource, supporting future Final Year Projects (FYPs), postgraduate research, and critical clinical collaborations for years to come[cite: 130, 131].
